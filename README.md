### Work in progress

mraro (or mra for cool cats) is a CMS written in PHP. It uses (and comes with):

- [Markdown][1] (the [php port][2])
- [pagedown][3]
- [nativesortable][4]

  [2]: http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/
  [3]: https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/
  [4]: https://github.com/bgrins/nativesortable

###Install

To install, go to the folder **mra/admin** and run:

    ./mra_init
from the command line (making sure the file is executable).

This will create:

- the *content* folder with a couple of example pages
- the settings files (*mra.conf* and *menu.conf*)
- an empty cache directory (*mra/tmp*)
